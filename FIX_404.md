# Fix for 404 Error on /dashboard/analytics/

## Quick Fix

The URL is correctly configured, but Django needs to reload the URL patterns. 

### Solution 1: Restart Django Server (Most Common Fix)

1. **Stop the Django development server** (press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Try accessing** `/dashboard/analytics/` again

### Solution 2: Check for Import Errors

If restarting doesn't work, there might be an import error. Check the terminal/console where Django is running for any error messages.

### Solution 3: Verify URL Configuration

The analytics URLs are configured in `myApp/urls.py` at lines 32-33:
```python
path('dashboard/analytics/', views.analytics_dashboard, name='analytics'),
path('dashboard/analytics/export/', views.analytics_export, name='analytics_export'),
```

### Solution 4: Run Migrations First

Before accessing analytics, make sure you've run migrations for the new models:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Solution 5: Check User Permissions

The analytics dashboard requires staff permissions. Make sure you're logged in as a staff user:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Or make your user staff:
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
>>> User = get_user_model()
>>> user = User.objects.get(username='your_username')
>>> user.is_staff = True
>>> user.save()
```

### If Still Not Working

1. Check the Django server console for any error messages
2. Verify the view function exists: `myApp/views.py` line 1426
3. Check that `analytics_views.py` exists and has no syntax errors
4. Try accessing `/dashboard/` first to ensure basic routing works
